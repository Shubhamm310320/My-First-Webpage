# HTML and CSS fundamentals

## Web Development Basics

1. **Clients & Servers**

   - A **client** is a device (like your phone or computer) that requests information from a website.

   - A **server** is a powerful computer that stores website data and sends it to clients when requested.

   > **Example:** When you type a website address (`www.google.com`) into your browser, your device **client** **requests** the page from a **server**, which then sends back the webpage as the **response**.

2. **Static vs. Dynamic Websites**

   - **Static Websites:** These show the same content to everyone and don’t change unless the developer manually updates them.

   > **Example:** A basic personal portfolio website.

   - **Dynamic Websites:** These update content based on user interaction or data from a database.

   > Example: Facebook, Amazon (where content changes based on users).

3. **Frontend vs. Backend**

   - **Frontend (Client-side):** Everything users see and interact with in their browser.

   - **Backend (Server-side):** The logic, database, and server operations that make the website function.

4. **Core Technologies**

   - **Frontend Technologies:**

     - **HTML** – Defines the structure (headings, paragraphs, buttons).
     - **CSS** – Styles the website (colors, fonts, layout).
     - **JavaScript** – Adds interactivity (buttons, animations, pop-ups).

   - **Backend Technologies:**

     - \*\* \*\* Python, JavaScript (Node.js), PHP, Java, Ruby, etc.

     - \*\* \*\* MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (store and manage data).

     - \*\* \*\* Apache, Nginx, cloud platforms like AWS.
